I hail from the city Allahabad located in the Gangetic plains of northern India. Although most of my childhood was spent at a very small industrial town some 350 kms away in the foothills of the Vindhya range. I became interested in astronomy through watching numerous documentaries on the Discovery channel as a child, and then later developed interest in coding in high school. This has now lead me to working in astrophysics research.\nI am currently working on problems related to relativistic astrophysics in the strong gravity regime. My works span both in X-rays and Gravitational Waves. I am currently working towards my PhD in Theoretical Physics at Fudan University.\nI have a lot of interests and like discussing science, philosophy, music, movies and food. I play guitar and harmonium, and have a diploma in Hindustani classical music.\n","date":"2022-09-10T14:52:51+05:30","permalink":"https://quasinormalguy.github.io/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"}]
