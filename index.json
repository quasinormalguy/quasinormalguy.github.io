I became interested in astronomy through watching numerous documentaries as a child, and then later developed interest in coding in high school. This has now lead me to working in astrophysics research - where I study the astrophysical systems using numerical simulations.\nI am currently working on problems related to relativistic astrophysics in the strong gravity regime. My works span both in X-ray and gravitational wave astrophysics. I am currently working as a postodoctoral fellow at the department of Physics at Fudan University.\nI have a lot of interests and like discussing science, philosophy, music, movies, food and FLOSS. I play guitar and harmonium, and have a diploma in Hindustani classical music.\n","date":"2022-09-10T14:52:51+05:30","permalink":"https://quasinormalguy.github.io/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"}]
